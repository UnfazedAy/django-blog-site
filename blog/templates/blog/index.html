            <p>
              There's nothing like the views you get when hiking in the
              mountains! And I wasn't even prepared for what happened whilst I
              was enjoying the view!

  <h2>What I Do</h2>
  <p>
    I love programming, I love the feeling of creating something from nothing,
    and I love the feeling of solving problems. I also love to write about my
    experiences and share them with the world. More so I love to team up with
    other developers and create something awesome!
  </p>
  <p>
    My goal is to keep on growing as a developer and to keep on learning new
    things. I also want to build a full blown web application that will be used
    by millions of people around the world.
